#  Google-Speech-To-Text

 This project is for a Control Automation Engineering major exhibition of 2019 1st Semester. Team name is Archisemtle. 

 I completed 2019 Google study jam beginner. then, I thought "Could it be possible to correct pronunciation by using STT". So, I try to use Google API Platform.

 This code is mostly Google example code. [[Google Code](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/streaming-recognize?hl=ko)]
